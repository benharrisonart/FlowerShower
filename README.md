# FlowerShower
Automated watering system for a custom plant pot and online data with notifications.

Automatically water your plant when the soil is detected by a Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v2.0 to be too dry. 

We will publish environmental data detected in the room as well as data collected by the moisture sensor to an Adafruit dashboard.
We will send email or SMS notifications based on changes in collected data using Zapier.
